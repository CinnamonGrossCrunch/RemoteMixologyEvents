# **Remote Mixology **Events** FAQ**

_This page outlines what Remote Mixology Events are, how to sign your team up for them, what fun things to expect from booking, and how much an event might cost_.

### **"Ok, so what *are* Remote Mixology Events!?"**

> "These are a great way to bring your team together by having a synchronized lesson of crafting a cocktail (and/or mocktail!) no matter how far and wide your team is distributed!  GitHub's resident Craft Cocktail Bartender(@cinnmaongrosscrunch), curates, bottles, labels, packs, and ships all-inclusive Cocktail Kits to Hubber door-steps in the USA and Canada. These arrive 1-2 days ahead of the scheduled event. 
 The day of the event, Matt is there to go through the ingredients one by one, including a short explanation of how they're made and their importance to the cocktail, as well as the main spirit's background, fun facts etc. This is then followed by professional bartending techniques to assemble and serve the cocktail."

### **"Some of our team members don't drink, is a mocktail version of your cocktail kits available?"**
> 
> "ABSOLUTELY! These kinds of requests are encouraged to make certain that everyone is included. There are tons of delicious options for  alcoholic substitutes!

### **"How far out should these events be booked?"**
> "At least two weeks head's up is ideal for planning purposes. This includes having a final head count and mailing list. Costs for shipping tend to go up markedly for shorter turnaround."

### **"How is the event's Cocktail/Mocktail chosen?"**
> 
> I have growing list of cocktails to choose from that are tailored for these Remote Mixology Events. These cocktails balance factors like ingredient quality, shelf life, ship-ability, and cost.  Choosing from these cocktails greatly simplifies event preparation. However, If you and your team have something unique in mind, I would love to collaborate to see what might be a practical solution! Unique requests will increase the event cost total.

### **We would love to participate in the cocktail/mocktail class portion but time and/or budget are running too short for cocktail kits.  Is it possible to send a shopping list for team members to pick up on their own for us to mix along with?**

> Certainly. This works better for smaller teams where coordination can be more streamlined.
