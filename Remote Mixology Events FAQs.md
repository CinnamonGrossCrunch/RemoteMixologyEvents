# **Team Mixology **Events** FAQ**

This page answers questions regarding what Team Mixology Events are, how to sign your team up for them, what fun things to expect from booking, and how much an event might cost.

#### **"Ok, so what *are* Team Mixology Events!?"**

> "Team Mixology Events are a great way to bring your team together by having a synchronized lesson of crafting cocktails (and/or mocktails!) no matter how far and wide your team is distributed!  Have your team receive curated, hand-crafted, all-inclusive Cocktail Kits (includes the necessary bar tools!) shipped to their door-steps. These arrive 1-2 days ahead of the scheduled event. 
On the day of the event, we will go through the ingredients one by one, including an explanation of their importance to the cocktail, as well as the main spirit's background, fun facts etc. This is then followed by a step-by-step proces showing professional bartending techniques to assemble and serve the cocktail."


#### **"Some of our team members don't drink, is a mocktail version of your cocktail kits available?"**
> 
> "ABSOLUTELY! These kinds of requests are encouraged to make certain that everyone is included. There are tons of delicious options for alcoholic substitutes!
Depending on the chosen cocktail, other requests pertaining to diet and allergy can be accomodated as well!


#### **"How far out should these events be booked?"**
> "At least two weeks head's up is required for planning purposes. This includes having a final head count and mailing list two weeks in advance as a lot goes into sourcing materials and ingredients for each event. Costs for shipping tend to go up markedly for shorter turnaround.  There is more flexibilty for teams located in the immediate Bay Area, and for those teams who wish to purchase the ingredients for their own cockatil/mocktail ingredients"



#### **"How is the event's Cocktail/Mocktail chosen?"**
> 
> I have a few seasonal options specifically tailored for these 
Mixology Events. These cocktails balance factors like ingredient quality, shelf life, ship-ability, and cost. If you and your team have something unique in mind, I would love to collaborate to see what might be a practical solution!

#### **How many Cocktails/Mocktails can be made from one Kit?**
> This is the team gift that keeps on giving with the average cocktail kit yielding _**Four**_ Cocktails!!! 


#### **What all comes in the Cocktail/Mocktail Kit?**
> 
> - Quality Cocktail (or mocktail!) Ingredients
> - Produce (Citrus/Hebs)
> - Cocktail Shaker Set
> - Cocktail Strainer
> - Measuring jigger


#### **We would love to participate in the cocktail/mocktail class portion but time and/or budget are running too short for cocktail kits.  Is it possible to send a shopping list for team members to pick up on their own for us to mix along with?**

> Certainly! This works better for smaller teams where coordination can be more streamlined.  


#### **Ok, how much do I need to budget for one of these Team Mixology Events?**

> There are several parameters that determine the cost to host a Team Mixology Event including the location of attendees(where Cocktail Kits are shipped to), total number of attendees, turnaround time, and special requests.
